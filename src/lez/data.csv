We have the opportunity to explore proposals without needing to charge or ban certain vehicles. Covid-19 has led to changes in lifestyle, work and travel behaviours, which has cleaned up some of our journeys and encouraged people to change their travel habits. Latest air quality monitors demonstrate that despite traffic levels increasing, the city centre’s pollution has remained relatively low.

A new approach is being developed and agreed with the government’s Joint Air Quality Unit as the most constructive way to refocus Bristol’s clean air plans, It is called ‘test and learn’ approach. The government has recognised the impact of Covid 19 on the city and is no longer requiring the council to implement a diesel ban. This option is not being considered further.

The council is still required to plan for implementing a medium and small charging zone if needed. The government have also recognised that we won’t be able to submit a full business case (FBC) setting out our preferred scheme until next February to allow us to pursue our test and lean approach and to be able to consult on the new proposals.

If after testing these measures a charging Clean Air Zone is still required for us to reduce NO2 levels to within legal limits as quickly as possible, then Bristol City Council would propose a small zone rather than medium area.",https://www.cleanairforbristol.org/,8/20/2020,"Bristol, City of",
