# Google Maps Explorer for SupplyChainSchool and SustainabilityTool GIS Data

This is a single-page web application for displaying public GIS data from the `SupplyChainSchool.co.uk` and `SustainabilityTool.com` sites.

## Quick start (admins)

 * Update the `mep/data.csv` CSV file with the latest data
 * Commit the changes into GitHub

Jenkins will parse the CSV file into a corresponding JSON data file (called `data.json`) and publish the files to the static file server.
